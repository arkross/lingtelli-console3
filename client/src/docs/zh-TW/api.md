# 語智網 Chatbot API

Chatbot API allows more flexible integration with client's existing system and/or applications. To be able to use this API, make sure these requirements are fulfilled:

1. You own a Lingtelli Chatbot Account.
2. You **own a Chatbot** and its **API function is activated**.

> Every Chatbot is assigned a unique `vendor_id`. To get started, obtain `vendor_id` from the Chatbot dashboard. Then simply make a `GET` request to [Bot Info](#bot-info), replacing `{vendor_id}` with the proper value.

```http
GET {{{BASE_URL}}}/info
```

If the request returns `200 OK`, you're ready to go.

## Message

```http
POST {{{BASE_URL}}}/
```

Post a message to a Chatbot. Returns `403 FORBIDDEN` if Chatbot's API functions is not activated.

User ID (`userId` or `uid`) is used to identify the origin of input (user). Every user should have their unique ID. Same `userId` will be treated as a single origin by the user, which means they will use the same dialogue session, and shares the [History](#history).

In a case which you need to allow **a user to simultaneously chat with the same bot** on different instances and/or topics, it is advised to assign different `userId` on each instance. This way, the instances will be treated as different topics and will not interfere with each other.

A [Postback](#postback-structure) message request may only be sent if the last Chatbot's reply is a [MultipleChoice](#multiplechoice-structure).

Response structure depends on the following factors:

2. Chatbot's understanding of user input.

##### Response Structure Definition

| -- | -- | -- | -- |

| off | [PlainText](#plaintext-structure) | [MultipleChoice](#multiplechoice-structure) | [PlainText](#plaintext-structure) |

##### Response Type Definition

1. `"answer"` means the Chatbot comprehends the input and found a matching question in the FAQ set. The Chatbot replies with an answer.
2. `"no_answer"` means the Chatbot comprehends the input, but was unable to confidently find a matching question in the FAQ set. The Chatbot replies with `postbackTitle` and suggests multiple similar questions ([Postback](#postback-structure)) for the user to choose from.
3. `"error"` means the Chatbot fails to comprehend the input, and therefore unable to suggest anything. The Chatbot replies with the `failedMsg` as error message.
